* GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
* WHEN I open the planner THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* WHEN I scroll down THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
* WHEN I view the time blocks for that day THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* WHEN I click into a time block THEN I can enter an event
* WHEN I click the save button for that time block THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
* WHEN I refresh the page THEN the saved events persist
